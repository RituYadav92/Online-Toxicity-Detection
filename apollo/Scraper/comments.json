Slums are better compared with poor trailer parks communities or even projects in USA.... In America due to all the building code and stuff,  its not going to be possible to create a place like the slums in India,  where  as the Slums were already there for a long time and now it become like a community and so hard to remove that the cities has to be build around it. It is true that food and cloths and even healthcare is cheap in India,  which is the way it should be. Although in America we have food banks and lot of organization trying to help out,  it's just not enough and America govt spend considerably less money on these type of things including public education and healthcare. I would say that it is the over the top capitalist attitude. Some of the reasons why American ppl have anger issues are because those who have that work hard attitude  falls prey to the capitalism. For example,  overpriced healthcare that can literally bankrupt ppl with a serious illness even if they have insurance,  less restrictions on preservatives that goes into food that makes ppl sick  and the banking system along with buy more stuff attitude  are designed where you  can't save any money. And majority of ppl just have straight forward jobs that they depend on without much guarantee here and unlike India you can't do much side gigs  without having all sorts of paper work and permissions... So American ppl are set up for failure.
